## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm Shreya Verma, currently pursuing a B.Tech in CSE with a specialization in AI and Data Science from MIT-WPU, Pune.

I have strong technical expertise in Python, Java, C/C++, web development, UI/UX design using Figma, AR/VR, and various database management systems. I'm also expanding my skills in Flutter, having completed a basic project in app development. My experience in data science, machine learning, and deep learning is backed by work with frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.
I've worked on a variety of projects, which you can check out on my GitHub: https://github.com/vermu490. I also actively participate in hackathons and workshops to stay on the cutting edge of technology.
I'm currently involved in several exciting projects across different domains. If you're interested in collaborating, feel free to reach out!

You can contact me on LinkedIn or via email at verma.shreya.094@gmail.com.
